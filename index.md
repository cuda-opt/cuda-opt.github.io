## Overview

Modern GPU programming often involves writing complex, performance-critical CUDA kernels. This project introduces an **agentic workflow** approach that:
- Automates the generation and optimization of CUDA kernels.
- Provides a modular system for iteratively refining code based on performance metrics.
- Integrates seamlessly with existing CUDA development environments.

By leveraging agent-based methods, the system is designed to continuously improve kernel efficiency while reducing the manual burden on developers.

## Features

- **Automated Kernel Generation:**  
  Agents analyze high-level problem definitions and generate CUDA kernel code accordingly.
  
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  Iterative performance evaluation and code refactoring are built into the workflow to ensure optimal GPU utilization.
  
- **Modular Design:**  
  Easily extendable architecture allows for custom agent behaviors, integration with external libraries, and adaptation to different problem domains.
  
- **Benchmarking & Testing:**  
  Automated testing and benchmarking suites evaluate kernel performance and validate correctness.
  
- **Documentation & Examples:**  
  Comprehensive documentation and usage examples help developers get started quickly and understand best practices.

## Architecture

The project is structured into several key modules:

- **Agent Core:**  
  The brain behind the workflow. It coordinates the generation, testing, and optimization cycles.
  
- **Kernel Generator:**  
  Converts high-level descriptions into CUDA kernel code.
  
- **Optimizer:**  
  Applies optimization techniques (e.g., memory access pattern improvements, loop unrolling) to boost performance.
  
- **Benchmark Suite:**  
  Automatically runs performance tests on generated kernels, providing feedback for further optimization.
  
- **Interface Layer:**  
  A command-line and optional graphical interface for interacting with the workflow.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **CUDA Toolkit:**  
  Ensure you have the CUDA Toolkit installed (version 10.0 or higher recommended).

- **C++ Compiler:**  
  A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

- **Python 3.x:**  
  Required for scripting and automation components.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-cuda-workflows.git
   cd agentic-cuda-workflows
